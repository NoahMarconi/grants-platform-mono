## app/pages

Client side routes `client/src/app/pages/pages-routing.module.ts`.

### dashboard

Unauthenticated landing page, shows a few of the latest grants.

![landing](docs/dashboard.png)

### grant view

Detail view for grant:

![grantview](docs/grantview.gif)

### my-grants

Index view for all user grants. User would be one of a Donor, Grantee, or Manager. Grants arranged in columns based on role.

![my grants](docs/mygrants.png)

### create-new-grant

Configure and launch a new grant contract.

Grant description is stored in back end db.

![create grant](docs/create.png)

Grant funds may be split between grantees by indicating precise amounts or by diving into percentages

![Grant Percentages](docs/newgrantpercentages.gif)

### grant-details

Shows current state of grant. Based on role, more or less interaction options exist (e.g. cancel grant, approveRefund, fund, etc.).

#### Grantee View (grant details)

## app/services

- Smart contract calls are managed by `client/src/app/services/ethcontract.service.ts` and currently assume a Metamask web3 provider is available on the page.
- Auth services are currently handled by `client/src/app/services/authentication.service.ts`. Near-term todo is to defer to 3box.io for authentication.
- Remaining services manage pending notifying backend of pending Smart Contract transactions and handling off chain data.

# server

Server intended to provide access to offchain data, such as grant descriptions, track pending transactions, and provide history cache.

## user

`server/src/server/user/user.module.ts`

User registry. Plan to largely replace with 3box.io

## grant

`server/src/server/grant/grant.module.ts`

Records grants launched through the Open Grants front end. Replicates basic data stored on-chain as well as additional context such as the grant details (written summary / pitch for grant).

## signal

To be developed. Will track on chain `signalling` using [carbon-vote-like interface](https://github.com/NoahMarconi/grant-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ISignal.sol) and events from the reference implementation. Serves as the basis for trending grants list.

## helpers

`server/src/helpers/schedule.service.ts`

CRON job to check status of pending transactions

# TODO

- [x] Do not ask user for address. Capture from Metamask or 3box.io integration
- [x] The Graph https://thegraph.com/ for queries
- [x] ETH/WEI and TOKEN/Atomic Uint conversion
- [x] Grantees and Manager should be address strings OR ens records
- [x] Permit views for non registered users (any 3box auth lets user in)
- [x] reset secrets
- [x] npm audit
- [ ] Editor license
- [x] UI refactor for each ROLEâ€™s { NULL, Manager, Grantee, Donor } grant view
- [ ] CI CD with docker
- [ ] Use factory contract to deploy new grants. Confirm factory has required events for tracking.

#### Rev May 25, 2020

- [ ] move env to .env
- [ ] config external mongo service
- [ ] SSL
- [ ] After factory contract used, capture all grant contract data from The Graph
- [ ] remove web3js
- [ ] Grantee column for my grants
- [ ] Determine network from webprovider
- [ ] Hide grants (user)
- [ ] Delete grants from db (admin)
- [ ] review use of npm package `docker`

#### Backlog

- [ ] DAI support
- [ ] Arbitrary token support
- [ ] ENS integration
- [ ] (EIP related) Determine whether link to grant description stored in grant contract or defer to ENS
